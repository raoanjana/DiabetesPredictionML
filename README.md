# DiabetesPredictionML

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to diabetes diagnosis. We will be training several models and subsequently evaluating which yields the highest prediction accuracy given the following feature set: number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function results, and age.

This project comprises of data exploration, model learning and model evaluation. In the data exploration phase, we aim to understand the landscape of the data primarily paying attention to outcome imbalance and feature correlation. In the model learning and evaluation phase, we train several supervised and unsupervised models. We then determine the accuracy score of each model (number of successful predictions over the number of total predictions).

The data used in the project is collected from women of Pima Native American descent of at least 21 years of age. While we recognize the limited population scope, we see this as a proof-of-concept that could be scaled across multiple demographic groups.

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set.
